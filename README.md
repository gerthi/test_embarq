My take on the [Getaround](https://www.getaround.com/) (ex Drivy) [backend](https://github.com/drivy/jobs/tree/master/backend) challenge.

All levels completed with testing.

Run `rspec spec/spec.rb --format doc` from a level folder (which will create the desired output file).
Or `ruby main.rb` to manually output the .json.
